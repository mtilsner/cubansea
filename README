Welcome to the implementation of the CubanSea Search Interface

This is an experimental project. In order to run the program, make sure that
you are connected to the internet and that Grails 1.1+ & Java 1.6+ are properly
installed and all environment variables are set. Then run
   grails run-app
and point your browser to http://localhost:8080/CubanSea. Please note that the
interface currently supports only Firefox 3+. Other browser support will be
added later.
